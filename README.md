# Overview

This repository is an analysis that explores the short-term rental registrations in Toronto. I explore a dataset from Open Data Toronto that was recorded by The City of Toronto. I focus on the 25 wards of Toronto, which of the wards have the highest short-term rental registrations, and how this information is relevant to prospective tenants and property owners.

## File Structure

This repository contains 3 files: 'inputs', 'outputs', and 'scripts'. The 'inputs' folder contains any raw and cleaned data that will be referenced in the analysis. The 'outputs' folder contains my list of references along with the paper. The 'scripts' folder contains how I imported the data (00-dowload_data), cleaned the data (00-aquire), and simulated the data (00-simulation).
